# Todoist Workflow Enhancements
This is a compilation of my custom workflows using the Todoist API, designed to boost my everyday productivity. 

While currently tailored to my specific requirements, I'm working on adapting it to be more universal, allowing you to develop your own efficient workflows.

## Deployment
It is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using Kustomize. It uses a CI workflow to update the image version automatically, so that the cluster will always use the last version.
