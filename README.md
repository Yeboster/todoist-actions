# Todoist Workflow Enhancements
This is a compilation of my custom workflows using the Todoist API, designed to boost my everyday productivity. 

While currently tailored to my specific requirements, I'm working on adapting it to be more universal, allowing you to develop your own efficient workflows.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using Kustomize. 
It incorporates a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow that automatically updates the image version, ensuring the cluster consistently operates with the latest version.
